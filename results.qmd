This graph shows a five point summary for each of the 7 ways of transportation in the dataset grouped by during the pandemic and post pandemic. This highlights the outliers, range, and central points of each form of transportation. To interpret this graphic, values below 1 mean that the useage of the specified form of transportation during the time period was below that of the pre-pandemic days. In contrast, values above 1 mean that the useage of the form of transportation was higher than that of the pre-pandemic days. From this graphic, we observe that during the pandemic, % of compareable pre-pandemic was almost exclusively below 1 meaning that the useage of almost all transportations went down for almost every single day. Few exceptions lie in the Access A Ride, Bridge and Tunnels, and Staten Island Railway. The central point of all forms of transportation for post-pandmic is higher than that of the same form of transportation during the pandemic which is to be expected. However, we can see that the central point tends to be below 1 meaning MTA hasn't seemed to have fully recovered or hasn't grown since pre-pandemic days.

This graphic shows overall monthly ridership across subways, buses, LIRR, and Metro-North. We can see trends of ridership with respect to time. Early 2020, we can observe a sharp dip when the COVID-19 pandmic lockdowns started. We can see an upward trend in ridership as COVID-19 restrictions lift.

This graphic shows percentage recovery during the pandmeic and post-pandemic. Similar to the first graphic, we notice how MTA did not make a full recovery which would be marked at the 1.0 mark for percentage of pre-pandemic. We can see similar results as Bridge and Tunnels seems to be the least impacted form of transportation while subway was more highly impacted. This can be observed as subway can be seen on the lower portion of the graphic.

From the previous graphics, I noticed that Bridges and Tunnels seemed to differ from the other modes of transportation. The percentage recovery was typically higher than other modes. Logically, this makes sense as Bridges and Tunnel traffic can be impacted by both public transportation (buses) and "private transportation" such as cars and motorcycles. This graphic investigates the overall traffic over time for bridges and tunnels. This shows sharp declines in COVID-19 restrictions were placed but recovered very quickly.
