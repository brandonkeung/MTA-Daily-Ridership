    "text": "1 Introduction\nExplain why you chose this topic, and the questions you are interested in studying. Provide context for readers who are not familiar with the topic.\nAs two individuals who recently moved to New York City, we decided to choose a dataset that related to the MTA which primarily resides in New York City. Our team intends to leverage the MTA’s daily ridership data to derive actionable insights that could enhance the New York City transit system. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is a vital agency responsible for operating public transportation in New York City, including subways, buses, commuter rail, and paratransit services. The daily ridership dataset, commencing on March 1, 2020, offers granular information on system-wide ridership and traffic patterns across various modes of transportation including the Staten Island Railway, buses, Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, Access-A-Ride, and Bridges and Tunnels.\nWe aim to analyze these data to understand the MTA’s operational dynamics over time, assess ridership frequency and volume, compare pre- and post-pandemic usage, and identify emerging trends in passenger behavior.We believe these areas of focus would be able to paint a vivid picture of New York City’s past and present behaviors as well as providing some insights on areas of improvements and or decline. With data from 03/01/2020 to 11/14/2024, we are able to see how the total estimated ridership changed over the past 4 years.",

    "text": "2.1 2.1 Description\nIdentify one or more data sources (see II. D. above) that you propose to draw on for the project. For each, describe how the data are collected and by whom. Describe the format of the data, the frequency of updates, dimensions, and any other relevant information. Note any issues / problems with the data, either known or that you discover. Explain how you plan to import the data. Carefully document your sources with links to the precise data sources that you used. If that is not possible (for example if your data is not available online, then explain that clearly.)\nThis data was collected by the state of New York for Data.gov; an official website of the United States government. This dataset is intended for public access and use and is covered by the Terms of Use under Data.gov.\nThe data is recorded in a csv format and with daily updates. The daily ridership dataset provides systemwide ridership and traffic estimates for subways (including the Staten Island Railway), buses, Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, Access-A-Ride, and Bridges and Tunnels, beginning 3/1/2020. Currently, we are only looking at this dataset but are open to exploring other datasets that are relevant to this topic.\nAt a glance, the column names are descriptive but can be slightly ambiguous. For example, LIRR was not specified and further research needed to be done to determine that this stood for Long Island Rail Road. In addition, it is slightly ambiguous how the % of compareable pre-pandemic day is calculated. Further investigation into the dataset and its background will be needed to deduce this.",

    "text": "This graph shows a five point summary for each of the 7 ways of transportation in the dataset grouped by during the pandemic and post pandemic. This highlights the outliers, range, and central points of each form of transportation. To interpret this graphic, values below 1 mean that the useage of the specified form of transportation during the time period was below that of the pre-pandemic days. In contrast, values above 1 mean that the useage of the form of transportation was higher than that of the pre-pandemic days. From this graphic, we observe that during the pandemic, % of compareable pre-pandemic was almost exclusively below 1 meaning that the useage of almost all transportations went down for almost every single day. Few exceptions lie in the Access A Ride, Bridge and Tunnels, and Staten Island Railway. The central point of all forms of transportation for post-pandmic is higher than that of the same form of transportation during the pandemic which is to be expected. However, we can see that the central point tends to be below 1 meaning MTA hasn’t seemed to have fully recovered or hasn’t grown since pre-pandemic days.\n\nThis graphic shows overall monthly ridership across subways, buses, LIRR, and Metro-North. We can see trends of ridership with respect to time. Early 2020, we can observe a sharp dip when the COVID-19 pandmic lockdowns started. We can see an upward trend in ridership as COVID-19 restrictions lift.\n\n[FIX LABELS AND AXIS NOT READABLE]\n\nThis graphic shows percentage recovery during the pandmeic and post-pandemic. Similar to the first graphic, we notice how MTA did not make a full recovery which would be marked at the 1.0 mark for percentage of pre-pandemic. We can see similar results as Bridge and Tunnels seems to be the least impacted form of transportation while subway was more highly impacted. This can be observed as subway can be seen on the lower portion of the graphic.\nDeleted images/000012.png bc i dont think its a very helpful graphic\n\nFrom the previous graphics, I noticed that Bridges and Tunnels seemed to differ from the other modes of transportation. The percentage recovery was typically higher than other modes. Logically, this makes sense as Bridges and Tunnel traffic can be impacted by both public transportation (buses) and “private transportation” such as cars and motorcycles. This graphic investigates the overall traffic over time for bridges and tunnels. This shows sharp declines in COVID-19 restrictions were placed but recovered very quickly.\n\nThis stacked ba chart shows the proportion of the modes of transportation with respect to each year. The proportion is relatively unchanged throughout the years from 2020 to 2024. We can There is a slight decrease in proportion of subway ridership in 2021 compared to the other years and increase in proportion of bus ridership in 2021.\n\n\nThis graphic shows the trends of modes of transportation with respect to time. We can evidently see that subway is the most popular form of transportation throughout the entire time period observed. We also observe that metro-north seemed to have the least ridership throughout the time window. It is also common to see many different modes of transportation following similar patterns. For example, at the end of 2021/start of 2022, all modes of transportation can be seen with a dip.",
