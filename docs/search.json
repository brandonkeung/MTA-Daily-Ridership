    "text": "1 Introduction\nExplain why you chose this topic, and the questions you are interested in studying. Provide context for readers who are not familiar with the topic.\nAs two people who recently moved to New York City, we decided to choose a dataset that related to the MTA which primarily resides in New York City. Our team intends to leverage the MTA’s daily ridership data to derive actionable insights that could enhance the New York City transit system. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is a vital agency responsible for operating public transportation in New York City, including subways, buses, commuter rail, and paratransit services. The daily ridership dataset, commencing on March 1, 2020, offers granular information on system-wide ridership and traffic patterns across various modes of transportation including the Staten Island Railway, buses, Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, Access-A-Ride, and Bridges and Tunnels.\nWe aim to analyze these data to understand the MTA’s operational dynamics over time, assess ridership frequency and volume, compare pre- and post-pandemic usage, and identify emerging trends in passenger behavior.We believe these areas of focus would be able to paint a vivid picture of New York City’s past and present behaviors as well as providing some insights on areas of improvements and or decline. With data from 03/01/2020 to 11/14/2024, we are able to see how the total estimated ridership changed over the past 4 years.\n(suggested: 1/2 page)",

    "text": "2.1 2.1 Description\nIdentify one or more data sources (see II. D. above) that you propose to draw on for the project. For each, describe how the data are collected and by whom. Describe the format of the data, the frequency of updates, dimensions, and any other relevant information. Note any issues / problems with the data, either known or that you discover. Explain how you plan to import the data. Carefully document your sources with links to the precise data sources that you used. If that is not possible (for example if your data is not available online, then explain that clearly.)\nThis data was collected by the state of New York for Data.gov; an official website of the United States government. This dataset is intended for public access and use and is covered by the Terms of Use under Data.gov.\nThe data is recorded in a csv format and with daily updates. The daily ridership dataset provides systemwide ridership and traffic estimates for subways (including the Staten Island Railway), buses, Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, Access-A-Ride, and Bridges and Tunnels, beginning 3/1/2020. Currently, we are only looking at this dataset but are open to exploring other datasets that are relevant to this topic.\nAt a glance, the column names are descriptive but can be slightly ambiguous. For example, LIRR was not specified and further research needed to be done to determine that this stood for Long Island Rail Road. In addition, it is slightly ambiguous how the % of compareable pre-pandemic day is calculated. Further investigation into the dataset and its background will be needed to deduce this.",
