    "text": "1 Introduction\nExplain why you chose this topic, and the questions you are interested in studying. Provide context for readers who are not familiar with the topic.\nAs two individuals who recently moved to New York City, we decided to choose a dataset that related to the MTA which primarily resides in New York City. Our team intends to leverage the MTA’s daily ridership data to derive actionable insights that could enhance the New York City transit system. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is a vital agency responsible for operating public transportation in New York City, including subways, buses, commuter rail, and paratransit services. The daily ridership dataset, commencing on March 1, 2020, offers granular information on system-wide ridership and traffic patterns across various modes of transportation including the Staten Island Railway, buses, Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, Access-A-Ride, and Bridges and Tunnels.\nWe aim to analyze these data to understand the MTA’s operational dynamics over time, assess ridership frequency and volume, compare pre- and post-pandemic usage, and identify emerging trends in passenger behavior.We believe these areas of focus would be able to paint a vivid picture of New York City’s past and present behaviors as well as providing some insights on areas of improvements and or decline. With data we will be able to answer the question of where the MTA should focus their resources and policies to optimize ridership accessibility, ride time and rider capacity in the long term.",

Describe the format of the data, the frequency of updates, dimensions, and any other relevant information. Note any issues / problems with the data, either known or that you discover. Explain how you plan to import the data. Carefully document your sources with links to the precise data sources that you used. If that is not possible (for example if your data is not available online, then explain that clearly.)\nThis data was collected by the state of New York for Data.gov; an official website of the United States government. This dataset is intended for public access and use and is covered by the Terms of Use under Data.gov.\nThe data is recorded in a csv format and with daily updates. The daily ridership dataset provides systemwide ridership and traffic estimates for subways (including the Staten Island Railway), buses, Long Island Rail Road, Metro-North Railroad, Access-A-Ride, and Bridges and Tunnels, beginning 3/1/2020. Currently, we are only looking at this dataset but are open to exploring other datasets that are relevant to this topic.\nAt a glance, the column names are descriptive but can be slightly ambiguous. For example, LIRR was not specified and further research needed to be done to determine that this stood for Long Island Rail Road. In addition, it is slightly ambiguous how the % of compareable pre-pandemic day is calculated. Further investigation into the dataset and its background will be needed to deduce this.",

    "text": "3.1 How do the modes of transportation stack up to each other in terms of pre-pandemic ridership?\nThis graph shows a five point summary for each of the 7 ways of transportation in the dataset grouped by during the pandemic and post pandemic. This highlights the outliers, range, and central points of each form of transportation. To interpret this graphic, values below 1 mean that the useage of the specified form of transportation during the time period was below that of the pre-pandemic days. In contrast, values above 1 mean that the useage of the form of transportation was higher than that of the pre-pandemic days. From this graphic, we observe that during the pandemic, % of compareable pre-pandemic was almost exclusively below 1 meaning that the useage of almost all transportations went down for almost every single day. Few exceptions lie in the Access A Ride, Bridge and Tunnels, and Staten Island Railway. The central point of all forms of transportation for post-pandmic is higher than that of the same form of transportation during the pandemic which is to be expected. However, we can see that the central point tends to be below 1 meaning MTA hasn’t seemed to have fully recovered or hasn’t grown since pre-pandemic days.",

The percentage recovery was typically higher than other modes. Logically, this makes sense as Bridges and Tunnel traffic can be impacted by both public transportation (buses) and “private transportation” such as cars and motorcycles. This graphic investigates the overall traffic over time for bridges and tunnels. This shows sharp declines in COVID-19 restrictions were placed but recovered very quickly.",

Comparing the trends across all transportation modes will reveal resilience or vulnerabilities in the system. It is expected that different transportation modes might show varying recovery rates based on accessibility or dependence.Identifying patterns will help assess infrastructure priorities and evaluate public behavior changes.\n\nFindings: From the graph we can deduce that the subway has constantly been the preferred mode of transportation relative to all the other modes.It is also interesting to find that bridge and tunnel traffic has stayed very constant throughout the time frame.In regards to all the modes; it seems they have all stayed constant in terms of ridership preference as no mode has overtaken the other.Thus, identifying these patterns can help assess infrastructure priorities and evaluate public behavior changes.",

Comparing the “percentage of Comparable Pre-Pandemic Day” columns for each mode of transportation can highlight which transportation services have regained their ridership and which still fall behind.\n\nFindings: From the graphic, we can see that Bridges and tunnels as well as Access A Ride have seen the highest levels of recovery. We can hypothesize that this swift recovery is because commuters and people with disabilities really do not have many options when it comes to transportation.This information can influence policies can focus on struggling modes, promoting ridership through targeted interventions.",

From this visual it seems more people left the inner city to other neighborhoods that driving is a lot more feasible in while still having attachments (jobs, friends/family) in the city. As bridges and tunnels have recovered a lot better since the pandemic there can be discussions that can help align policies for congestion and emissions reduction.",

    "text": "Working on this project was very interesting and informative as it gave us the opportunity to discover the patterns of the MTA ridership across different modes at such a pivotal point in time. What we found to be very interesting was the high correlation between the different modes of transportation as well as the similarity in ridership regardless of the season and or day of the week- this is truly the city that never sleeps. We did encounter some technical difficulties with the interactive graphs however with persistent tuning we were able to get it up and running In regards to the data, there were a good amount of times where there has to be transformations in order to interpret it properly and then visualize it.\nIn the future we will be sure to look into additional datasets to broaden the scope of the analysis and uncover more hidden patterns and behaviors over time as a result of the economy, policy, additions and/or removals of routes or transportation modes. It would be very interesting to see how or if the current trends keep going in the same direction and at what speed, magnitude and for how long? These are just a few questions we would love to know about in addition to what we have now.",
